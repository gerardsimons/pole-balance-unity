# Pole Balance Unity 3D

The classic pole balance control problem as a Unity environment. The idea is to either use the Unity ML-agents or set it up as a general OpenAI gym (maybe both?) for people to play with. 

## Prerequisites

* Unity3D

## Run

Just double-click the PoleBalance/Assets/Scenes/PoleBalance.unity and run it!
